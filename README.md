**Early identification** and **social distancing** are _essential_ to reduce the spread of the virus.

* What can we do if we are tested positive?
* How do we know if we are already infected?
* How can we improve social distancing and reduce the spread of the virus?

**TimelineAnalyst** allows you to:
* Check if you crossed in the past a person that was tested positive using your data from Google Map Timeline;
* Identify the places with and high risk of infection for **people** to avoid them and **governments** to apply ad-hoc measures.
## Dependences
**TimelineAnalyst** requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) to be installed.
